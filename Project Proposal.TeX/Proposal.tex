		Sensor Network 
	
	\section{Goal}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Create a system to collect, transport, analyze, store, and visualize sensor data
			\item Control external systems manually or automatically according to sensor inputs
			\item Access user interface anywhere with an internet connection
		\end{itemize}
		
	\section{Objectives}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Build sensor modules built around existing sensors that interface and draw power from the wireless node
			\item Build wireless nodes that connect to the sensor module over a unified hardware interface. The nodes will form a mesh network to establish communication with the base station
			\item The base station will interface with the nodes and sensors, both reading sensor values and controlling modules. It will also host the database to store historic data and a server to interface with mobile apps
		\end{itemize}
